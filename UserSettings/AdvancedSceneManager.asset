    Addressables:

    - Made scene and addressable linking a
    lot more robust.


    SceneOperation:

    - Fixed SceneOperation not defaulting
    to the first scene of the collection, when SceneCollection.activeScene was null.


    Dynamic
    Collections:

    - Fixed ''\\'' wrongly being used as path separator instead
    of ''/'', which solves an issue on mac where ASM user settings was created using
    wrong name, and as a result, ending up outside /UserSettings/, which meant it
    would be synced to source.


    AssetRef:

    - Fixed AssetRef re-generating
    in batch mode.

    - Fixed issue where profiles, collection and scenes (but
    all other references were fine, strangely enough) were de-referenced from AssetRef
    when doing a clean build.

    - Fixed issue where AssetRef would re-generate
    singletons for no reason.


    Misc:

    - Added test for clean build.

    -
    Fixed issue where startup would run twice in unity 2022 (but not 2019 for some
    reason).

    - Fixed null ref during intro wizard, when making sure profile
    name is not duplicated.'
